# Using-CMAP

## What is this for?
This is a sample R code for using the ```cmapgeo``` package in R. The [package](https://github.com/CMAP-REPOS/cmapgeo) contains shapefiles for the city of Chicago as different geographies, including commmunity areas, census tracts, and congressional districts. The benefit of this package is that users will not need to import shapefiles each time they need to create a map.


## Who is this useful for?
This repository is likely most useful to data analysts working in the nonprofit space in Chicago.
